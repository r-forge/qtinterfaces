<h1>Interfaces to the Qt framework from R</h1>

<p> The goal of this project is to create a coherent collection of R
packages that provide an interface to the Qt application and UI
framework, with a focus on enabling GUI development and advanced
graphics. </p>

<p> The project is still in a development phase, and there is little
documentation.  However, it should be possible to install the packages
(from source) in the usual way on GNU/Linux or Mac OS X systems
provided you have installed the Qt libraries and development packages
and the <code>cmake</code> build system.

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<dl>
  <dt><code>Qt</code></dt>

  <dd>Qt 4.6 or better is required for these packages.  Qt binaries
    can be downloaded from <a
    href="http://qt.nokia.com/downloads" >this website</a> for
    Windows, Mac, and GNU/Linux.  The smaller &quot;Framework
    Only&quot; download is sufficient.  </dd>

    <dt><code>cmake</code></dt>

    <dd>Cmake 2.8.1 or better is also required.  Binaries can be
    downloaded from <a
    href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html"
    >here</a>.  </dd>

    <dt><code>git</code></dt>

    <dd>git is required to obtain the sources.  Binaries can be
    downloaded from <a href="http://git-scm.com/download" >here</a>.
    </dd>

</dl>

<p> Note that even though all dependencies are available on Windows,
the R packages themselves do not run on Windows (yet).  Windows
support is feasible, but involves a little more work, and is planned
once the packages are more stable. </p>

<p> Most GNU/Linux distributions should have packages for the
dependencies; e.g., on Debian, it should suffice to

<pre>$ sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools libqt4-dev \
       libqt4-opengl cmake git</pre>

</p>


<h2>Getting and installing the software</h2>

<p> The software produced by this project is available in the form of
several R packages.  The most important of these are
<code>qtbase</code>, which provides R bindings to (most of) the Qt
library, and <code>qtpaint</code>, which provides a low-level
framework for high-performance graphics.  Other packages are expected
to build on these packages to provide interfaces more directly useful
for the end-user.  </p>


<p> Primary hosting of the source code is at <a href="www.github.com"
>Github</a>.  To download and install <code>qtbase</code>, try </p>
<pre>$ git clone http://github.com/ggobi/qtbase.git
$ R CMD INSTALL qtbase
</pre>

<p>This will take a long time the first time.  When you want to update
to the latest version a few days later, do </p>

<pre>$ cd qtbase
$ git pull
$ cd ..
$ R CMD INSTALL qtbase
</pre>

<p>This should fetch the latest version of the source and install it,
but installation should take less time.  For a completely clean
install, do

<pre>$ cd qtbase/src
$ make clean</pre>

and install again. </p>

<!-- <p>Note: If you have multiple versions of Qt installed, make sure the -->
<!-- <code>QMAKE</code> environment variable points to the correct -->
<!-- <code>qmake</code> executable (check <code>$QMAKE --version</code>). -->
<!-- </p> -->

<p>The process for installing <code>qtpaint</code> is similar:</p>

<pre>$ git clone http://github.com/ggobi/qtpaint.git
$ R CMD INSTALL qtpaint
</pre>

<p>Other packages currently part of the project are </p>

<ul>

  <li><code>qtutils</code>, which provides utilities such as an R code
  editor (with syntax highlighting), a
  <code>QGraphicsScene</code>-based R graphics device, an object
  browser, etc., and </li>

  <li><code>mosaiq</code>, a high-level graphics package, not entirely
  unlike <code>lattice</code>. </li>

</ul>

<p>These can be installed in a similar fashion, although for these
packages it is recommended  that you go through the

<pre>$ R CMD build foo
$ R CMD INSTALL foo_x.y.z.tar.gz</pre>

cycle to keep the source clean. (This is also possible
<code>qtbase</code> and <code>qtpaint</code>, but not recommended
because of the long time required for a clean installation.)  </p>


<h2>Development</h2>

<p>The best way to get involved is to look at the archived mailing
list discussions and then start asking questions there.  </p>

<p>For development access, create an account at Github and send email
to the list.  Once you have been granted access, follow the
instructions at Github.  If you are new to <code>git</code>, <a
href="http://gitref.org/" >this site</a> should help you get up to
speed.  </p>


<h2>Other resources</h2>

<p> For mailing lists and bug tracking, see the R-forge <a
href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/qtinterfaces/">project
summary page</a>. </p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Some of the packages have demos in the <code>demo</code> directory.
Some are obsolete, but others are useful.  Both <code>qtbase</code>
and <code>qtpaint</code> have a vignette.  See also the
<code>qtbase/NOTES</code> file for some thoughts. </p>

<p>Slides and scripts from UseR! 2009 and DSC 2009 are given below.
These are obsolete for all practical purposes, but do give a
high-level background that may be useful in the absence of more
up-to-date material.  </p>

<h2>Using Qt Assistant to Browse R documentation</h2>

<p>Qt comes with a standalone application called <em>Qt
Assistant</em>, an advanced HTML help browser with an excellent user
interface and powerful features such as keyword indexing and full-text
search, that is used to display Qt documentation.  Assistant is
designed to be used with third-party documentation as well, but such
use requires all relevant files to be registered and compiled into a
binary collection beforehand. </p>

<p>R has a slightly different documentation model: it makes
documentation available <em>dynamically</em>, depending on the
packages currently in use.  Even more dynamic documentation is planned
for future versions, where documentation may be generated on-the-fly
during a running R session.  This model is incompatible with Qt's
model of static documentation.  </p>

<p> Having said that, most R sessions do not involve installing new
packages, and it is a good compromise to have static versions of
documentation for all installed packages available with a superior
interface.  The file </code><a href="rassistant.R">rassistant.R</a></code>
provides tools to register and compile (and optionally run) currently
available R HTML documentation into a form suitable for Qt
Assistant.  To use it on Linux/UNIX, type the following on the R command line:
<pre>
source("http://qtinterfaces.r-forge.r-project.org/rassistant.R")
generateCompiledHelpUnix()
generateCompiledCollection(start.assistant = TRUE)
</pre>
On the first run, this will produce a compiled help file
<code>rproject.qch</code> and a compiled collection file
<code>rproject.qhc</code> in the user's home directory (the first step
may take a while to run), and open it with Assistant.  The files are
actually self-contained, and may be moved to other systems and used
with Assistant as a standalone help collection.  </p>

<p> In subsequent sessions, just running 
<pre>
source("http://qtinterfaces.r-forge.r-project.org/rassistant.R")
generateCompiledCollection(start.assistant = TRUE)
</pre>
should start Assistant without regenerating the help file.  On UNIX
systems, Assistant can be run as a standalone application from the
command line using
<pre>
$ assistant -collectionFile ~/rproject.qhc
</pre>
(the location is customizable).
