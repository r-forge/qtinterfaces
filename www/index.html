<h2>Interfaces to the Qt framework from R</h2>

<p>This project aims to create a coherent collection of R packages
that provide an interface to the Qt application and UI framework, with
a focus on enabling GUI development and advanced graphics. </p>


<p>The project is in an early development stage, and there is no
documentation yet.  However, it should be possible to install the
packages (from source) in the usual way (<code>R CMD INSTALL</code>
or <code>install.packages()</code>) on Linux or Mac OS X provided you
have installed the Qt libraries and development packages (Qt 4.5 or
better).  If you have multiple versions of Qt installed, make sure
the <code>QMAKE</code> environment variable points to the
correct <code>qmake</code> executable (check <code>$QMAKE
--version</code>).
</p>

<h2>Using Qt Assistant to Browse R documentation</h2>

<p>Qt comes with a standalone application called <em>Qt
Assistant</em>.  Assistant is an advanced HTML help browser with
an excellent user interface and powerful features such as keyword
indexing and full-text search.  It is designed to be used with
third-party documentation (in addition to Qt documentation), but
requires all files to be registered and compiled into a binary
collection. </p>

<p>R has a slightly different documentation model: it makes
documentation available <em>dynamically</em>, depending on the
packages currently in use.  Even more dynamic documentation is planned
for future versions, where documentation may be generated on-the-fly
during a running R session.  This model is incompatible with Qt's
model of static documentation.  </p>

<p> Having said that, most R sessions do not involve installing new
packages, and it is a good compromise to have static versions of
documentation for all installed packages available with a superior
interface.  The file </code><a href="rassistant.R">rassistant.R</a></code>
provides tools to register and compile (and optionally run) currently
available R HTML documentation into a form suitable for Qt
Assistant.  To use it on Linux/UNIX, type the following on the R command line:
<pre>
source("http://qtinterfaces.r-forge.r-project.org/rassistant.R")
generateCompiledHelpUnix()
registerHelp()
generateCompiledCollection(start.assistant = TRUE)
</pre>
On the first run, this will produce a compiled help file
<code>rproject.qch</code> and a compiled collection file
<code>rproject.qhc</code> in the user's home directory (the first step
may take a while to run), and open it with Assistant.  The files are
actually self-contained, and may be moved to other systems and used
with Assistant as a standalone help collection.  </p>

<p> In subsequent sessions, just running 
<pre>
source("http://qtinterfaces.r-forge.r-project.org/rassistant.R")
generateCompiledCollection(start.assistant = TRUE)
</pre>
should start Assistant without regenerating the help file.
</p>
