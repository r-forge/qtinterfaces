This package is intended to be the provider of a low-level API
allowing the manipulation of Qt widgets from R.  Of course, various
high-level extensions are possible.  Those of particular interest to
me are (1) a high-level static graphics interface, with capabilities
similar to lattice, and (2) a high-level dynamic graphics interface,
similar to Ggobi (?).
