 o How to use new classes defined in C++, e.g., RSyntaxHighlighter

 o I define 
   qselectedText.QTextEdit <- function(x) { x$textCursor()$selection()$toPlainText() }
   Can I make it so that I can call this as x$selectedText()?
   Do I need to define a new (R-level) class for that?

 o static methods? e.g., QFileDialog::getSaveFileName 
   [ans: Qt$QFileDialog$getSaveFileName ]

 o Is user.data supported in qconnect?  qtbase/src/RDynamicQObject.cpp
   has a TODO which suggests not.

 o QFont conversion: why does this not work:

   > Qt$QFont(qfont())
   Error in qinvokeStatic(cl, name, ...) :
     Wrong number or types of arguments passed to 'QFont::QFont'

   Not a big deal, as we can do Qt$QFont("monospace") etc., but still
   curious, as QFont is handled in qtbase/src/convert.cpp
