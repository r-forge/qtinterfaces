TODO
===================================================

- Fix the bug Deepayan reported with QPen(QColor).
- Get rid of createProject.sh/qmake and replace with cmake. It is a
  much more functional build system. For example, we can detect the Qt
  modules present on the system and only build against those.
- Support SEXPs inside of QVariant
- Add an as.raster() to qtpaint, for convenience download of pixels.
- Make return-by-ref params work.
    Calling Smoke: Many of the marshallers set the sexp in
      such cases. We just have to detect this and form a result list.
    Virtual callbacks: Need special object for bundling multiple return values.
      MethodCall detects this and sets SEXPs appropriately.
- Figure out why the generator is missing QtDBus
- Documentation, probably by hacking into the 2.10 web server so that
  everything is dynamic.
- Eventually split off the Qt-specific bits, so that there is a
  general "rsmoke" package. It will still depend on Qt, but will not
  do any binding by itself.
