===================================================

- Fix the bug Deepayan reported with QPen(QColor).
- Better support for converting value types.
- Consider using Rcpp for wrapping SEXPs (especially useful for
  converting value types). The inline compilation is cool, too --
  maybe provide a wrapper?
- Get rid of createProject.sh/qmake and replace with cmake. It is a
  much more functional build system. For example, we can detect the Qt
  modules present on the system and only build against those.
- Figure out why the generator is missing QtDBus
- Documentation, probably by hacking into the 2.10 web server so that
  everything is dynamic.
- Eventually split off the Qt-specific bits, so that there is a
  general "rsmoke" package. It will still depend on Qt, but will not
  do any binding by itself.
