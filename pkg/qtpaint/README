This package is intended to be the provider of a low-level API
allowing the manipulation of Qt widgets from R.  Of course, various
high-level extensions are possible.  Those of particular interest to
me are (1) a high-level static graphics interface, with capabilities
similar to lattice, and (2) a high-level dynamic graphics interface,
similar to Ggobi (?), presumably using Qt's Graphics View framework.

The low-level tools for (2) are not even in the planning stages yet,
and would benefit from discussions with Michael.  The tools for a
rudimentary implementation of (1) are already there, and is used by 
the qtplot package.
