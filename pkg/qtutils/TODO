 o Rename to qtutils eventually (make older qtutils obsolete)

 o High level interface for file.show/page type things?

 o Keyboard shortcut for executing selected R code in editor (through actions?)

 o Allow saving files from editor (qsaveEditor?)

 o A data browser: show list of available datasets, and double-click
   to see help page?

 o An environment browser, but it's hard to decide when to do a
   tree-like thing (lists, environments) and when to display a
   node-like thing (data frame, function).  Maybe have a qstr()
   generic, which for nodes just shows them, and for list-like objects
   creates a list where clicking on any element x calls qstr(x) on a
   pane.

 o control of sizepolicy

 o control over alignment policy


FIXME: We currently have no good way to handle overloaded C++ methods.
   For example, QTableWidget::setItem() and QListWidget::setItem()
